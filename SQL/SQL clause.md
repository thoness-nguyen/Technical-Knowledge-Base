I see what happened üëç ‚Äî in your screenshot, the Markdown wasn‚Äôt properly separated into sections, so everything after START WITH collapsed into one big code block.

Here‚Äôs the fixed .md version where each concept has its own code block and explanation:

## 1. START WITH
**What it does**: Tells SQL where to begin the tree (the root nodes).  
**Usually**: the row(s) that don‚Äôt have a parent.  

**Example**:
```sql
START WITH id IN (-16, -19)
```

## 2. CONNECT BY

What it does: Tells SQL how to walk from parent ‚Üí child (the relationship rule).
Uses: PRIOR to say which side belongs to the parent row.

**Example:**
```sql
CONNECT BY PRIOR id = parent
-- Take the current row‚Äôs id and match it against the next row‚Äôs parent.
```

## 3. LEVEL

What it does: Built-in pseudo-column that shows how deep the row is in the tree.

Root = 1
Child = 2
Grandchild = 3

## 4. NOCYCLE 

What is does: prevent infinite loop.

## General Example:
```sql
SELECT LEVEL AS level, id
FROM MediaItemFolder
START WITH id IN (-16, -19)
CONNECT BY PRIOR id = parent;
```
